## Process 🎷
---
### Experiment 1
- No errors were encoutnered during the installation. The installation was done using chocolately.

### Experiment 2
- For somre reason, I was not able to add rabbitMQ as a maven dependency. Upon generating a pom file and adding it to dependency list, the compiler said that no such dependency was found. Adding the .jar file worked fine, however. Context wise, there haven't been any difficulties. 

### Experiment 3
  - Since the same .jars were used as in the experiment 1, there were no more issues regarding that. The tutorial was also quite simple and easy to follow along.

### Experiment 4
 - Similar as the previous expermints. The tutorial was easy to follow and understand.

## Overall summary 🧩
- The experiments were easy to follow.
- There were some issues with dependencies, however once they were resolved for one of the experiments, no issues were encountered in the other experiments.
- Since fixing dependencies is frustrating, I kept all the code form experiments in a single folder
