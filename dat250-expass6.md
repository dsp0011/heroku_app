## Process 🎷
---
### Experiment 1

 - The experiment was very similar to the ones done in Lab 5. In addition, the implementation of project B done by my group used controller structures, hence there weren't many new things in the experiment and no errors were encountered.  

### Experiment 2
- The experiment ran smooth. Setting the app locally and the tasks themselves were not difficult. I've already had epxerience with react, hence concepts like component programming, rendering, using props and state were not new.

---
## Overall summary 🧩

- No issues were encountered for either of the projects. The tutorials were thorough and easy to understand.
