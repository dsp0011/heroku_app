## Process 🌊

### Experiment 1

 - Fairly simple, just as it was done in the tutorial in a previoues lecture (lecture 10?). No errors were encountered. 
 - Selecting different dependencies and initializing a spring project seemed very simple and convenient

### Experiment 2
 - The description of the experiment was very thorough, hence no problems were encountered.
 - Overall, the request and response mapping using a controller seemed very clean and easy to use. 

### Experiment 3
 - Pretty similar to experiment 2, also no issues were encoutnered

### Experiment 4
 - The last experiment was quite useful as a basis for the project B, especially the user of a repository. Having a repository, which is able to store all the necessary data in addition to being able to share it between classes without passing it came in handy.

## Overall summary 🛺
Overall, all of the experiments went smooth. The guides were detailed and easy to follow, hence barely any problems were encountered.
The only problem was pushing the lab to git, due to subdirectories having separate .git folders that had to be deleted.
